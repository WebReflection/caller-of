go in a directory, if emty is better\n    # grab the built file from this repo\n    curl -0 https://raw.github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/master/build/polpetta >polpetta\n\n    # if you don't want to make\n    # polpetta executable\n    # point to polpetta via node\n    node ~/the/path/where/is/polpetta\n\n    # if you want make it executable\n    # be sure polpetta firstline points to the right\n    # bin folder with node then chmod it\n    chmod +x polpetta\n\n    # if that is the case, test if it runs via\n    # and exit via Ctrl+C or simply go to\n    # the http://address:port/ showed and start playing\n    ./polpetta\n\nYou should see something like this in your console (I have used the /tmp folder here)\n\n![polpetta at work](http://www.3site.eu/images/polpetta_shell.png)\n\n\n    # if you want make your life easier and call\n    # polpetta from anywhere, hoping you have not\n    # configured node as super user ( this could hurt )\n    which node\n    # output: /usr/local/bin/node\n\n    # move the file into that bin folder\n    [sudo] mv polpetta /usr/local/bin\n\n    # now, whatever folder you want ..\n    polpetta ~/myhtml/only/website/\n\n    # and you are ready to go\n\nIf you want clone this repository, help me improving *polpetta* or do some test/change, remember to `make` in order to build *polpetta* in the build folder then `node build/polpetta test` or any other path you like.\n\n\nMake options\n------------\n  * **build**, the default one, creates a freshly new backed *polpetta* in the *build/* folder\n  * **clean**, remove the build folder and everything included\n  * **types**, grab the Apache file, parse it, overwrite the [EXTENSION_TO_MIME.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/src/EXTENSION_TO_MIME.js) file and build *polpetta* again\n\n\nWhat About .njs Files\n---------------------\nIf the file extension is **.njs** it is **executed CGI (or PHP) style** but with the whole power of node.js.\nYou can `require(\"module\")` and do what you want and you receive per each web-server call the **request** and the **response** object.\nAll you have to do in your file is to export an `onload` function. This function will be called with a spiced up *polpetta* with some utility but you don't really have to use them, just do what you want.\n\n    // generic.njs file\n    this.onload = function (\n      request,\n      response,\n      polpetta\n    ) {\n      var fs = require(\"fs\");\n      fs.writeFileSync(\"gotcha.txt\", \"it works\");\n      response.end();\n      // note that polpetta here points\n      // to a new polpetta instance\n      // per each request lifecycle\n    };\n\n\nWhat About External npm Modules\n-------------------------------\nThere are two options here, the easy one and the even easier.\nThe easy one is about putting your modules in a folder called **node_modules** inside your project.\nThis folder is forbidden by default so nobody can read it through the url but you can `require(module)` without problems.\n\nThe even easier way is to install your most used modules globally via `npm install module -g` so that these will be available in any case through the node.js `require()` mechanism and you update one place rather than all of them, if necessary.\n\n\nWhat About Polpetta as Module\n-----------------------------\nIf you `require(\"./polpetta\")` file you gonna have a module with a *Polpetta* constructor.\nAny time you want to initialize a Polpetta instance you can `new Polpetta(request, response)`.\nAs easy way to use it for generic http server response, you can `http.createServer(Polpetta.factory);`\n\n\nWhat About .htaccess file\n-------------------------\nThe *.htaccess* file is a feature that lets you intercept few calls such *onrequest*, *onstaticfile*, and *onerror*.\nYou can find a\n[.htaccess example here](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/weird folder/.htaccess).\nThe .htaccess file works only if present in the root folder you chose for a polpetta instance. In all other folders this will be threaten as an hidden file rather than being parsed per each folder request. This simplifies and boost up **a lot** the server logic and is most likely everything you need. Here a summary of all current methods invoked, if present, with the .htaccess file.\n\n  * **onrequest**, performed *while polpetta is still backing*, you can use this event to create your own redirects, internals or external, or do any sort of crazy things you might think about.\n  * **onstaticfile**, performed once a non CGI/.njs file is going to be served. Here you can serve gzipped content or a completely different layout, accordingly with the file type.\n  * **onerror**, performed when something bad occurs. Usually, for bad we mean a forbidden 403, a not found 404, or an internal server error, with code 500. Here you can serve an alternative nice page, informing the user something went wrong or so something else, if you think it's necessary.\n\nEvery time a callback is invoked, the [event object](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/src/htaccess/invokedHtaccess.js) will be sent. If you want to stop a default polpetta behavior, simply use `even.preventDefault()` or `return false` at some point in the callback. This works like DOM Level 3 or DOM 0 events ... as easy as that.\n\n\nPolpetta API\n------------\nYou can find almost everything documented in the [prototype.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/src/Polpetta/prototype.js) file.\nLook closer and you will find a `polpetta.get(key[, default])` method, used to retrieve query string properties as it is for the PHP `$_GET[$key]` global, a `polpetta.post(key[, default])` method to retrieve posted data, a `polpetta.cookie(key[, default])` method, to get cookie, followed by `polpetta.cookie.set(key, value)` to set them.\nAll these objects have a `obj.keys()` method too to retrieve all parsed keys for *get*, *post*, *cookie*, or *file*.\n\nYou can see an examples for [cookie](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/cookie.njs), [get or post](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/post.njs), and [files upload](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/file.njs) in the test folder.\n\nLast, but not least, there is a `polpetta.output` **Array** property where you can push your content and `polpetta.output.flush([type || [code, type]])` once you have done.\nBear in mind this is not a good technique to serve big files on the fly but that's not the purpose of the `output` property.\n\n    // example of get and output\n    this.onload = function (req, res, p) {\n      p.output.push(\n        \"Hello \",\n          p.get(\"name\",\n            // default if not present\n            \"unknown\"\n          ),\n        \"!\"\n      );\n      p.output.flush(\"txt\");\n    };\n\n    // produced output for localhost:port\n    Hello unknown!\n\n    // produced output for localhost:port/?name=Polpetta\n    Hello Polpetta!\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis *polpetta* project is under the Mit Style License\n\n    Copyright (C) 2011 by Andrea Giammarchi, @WebReflection\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Why\n---------------\nI am maintaining different projects and I am sick of setting up a web-server per each project.\nYou might have noticed that most **recent browsers do not let us test through the *file://* protocol anymore** and this is the most annoying thing ever for a developer, imho.\nYou might be a *node.js* modules developer too and sometimes an easy way to test your modules is all you need.\nWith *polpetta* you can create as many server as you want per each folder and test them without setting up a damn thing.\nAccordingly, if you develop anything for the web or the *node.js* community, *polpetta* could be exactly the solution to all your problems.\n",
